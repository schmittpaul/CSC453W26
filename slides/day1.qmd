## Why take this class

- You are required to do so in order to graduate
- [Reality]{.alert}: this is how computers really work, and as a computer scientist or engineer you should know how computers really work
- [Ubiquity]{.alert}: operating systems are everywhere and you are likely to eventually encounter them or their limitations
- [Beauty]{.alert}: operating systems are examples of mature solutions to difficult design and engineering problems. Studying them will improve your ability to design and implement abstractions

## Course progression

- Introduction to operating system abstractions and structures
- Abstracting and multiplexing:
  - [CPU]{.alert}: interrupts, context, threads, processes, processor scheduling, thread synchronization, deadlocks
  - [Memory]{.alert}: memory layout, address translation, paging and segmentation, address spaces, translation caching, page fault handling, page eviction, swapping
  - [File systems and storage]{.alert}: disk scheduling, on-disk layout, files, buffer cache, crash and recovery
  - [Security]{.alert} (time permitting)

## What is an operating system?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

- Operating System:
  - A [computer program]{.alert} that
  - [multiplexes]{.alert} hardware resources and
  - implements useful [abstractions]{.alert}.
- The OS is just another computer program. Has the highest privilege. The core of the OS consists of the [kernel]{.alert}
- [Multiplexing]{.alert} allows multiple people or programs to use the same set of hardware resources - processors, memory, disks, network connection - safely and efficiently.
- [Abstractions]{.alert} simplify the usage of hardware resources by organizing information or implementing new capabilities.

## OS history - how did we get here?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

- Started out as [libraries]{.alert} to provide common functionality across programs
  - See any issues with this approach?
- Later, evolved from [procedure call]{.alert} to [system call]{.alert}
  - What's the difference?
- Evolved from running a single program to [multiple processes concurrently]{.alert}
  - New issues to solve?

::: {.notes}
- Imagine you allowed any process to read anywhere from the disk or memory. There is no privacy.

- Memory protection, concurrency / scheduling issues

## Types of operating systems

- Desktop
- Time share/Mainframe
- Mobile
- Web
- Real-time
- Embedded
- Virtual Machines

## Tl;dr
OSes continue to evolve as environments (i.e., constraints) change

# OS abstractions {background-color="#40666e"}

## Questions to consider
:::{.nonincremental}
- What are the main abstractions OSes provide?
- What are the abstraction challenges?
:::

## Abstractions

- Abstractions _simplify application design_ by:
  - hiding undesirable properties,
  - adding new capabilities, and
  - organizing information
- Abstractions provide an [interface]{.alert} to application programmers that separates [policy]{.alert}—what the interface commits to accomplishing—from [mechanism]{.alert}—how the interface is implemented.

## What are the abstractions?

- CPUs
  - Processes, threads
- Memory
  - Address space
- Disk
  - Files

## Example OS abstraction: file systems

- What [undesirable properties]{.alert} do file systems hide?
  - Disks are slow!
  - Chunks of storage are actually distributed all over the disk
  - Disk storage may fail!
- What [new capabilities]{.alert} do files add?
  - Growth and shrinking
  - Organization into directories, searchability
- What [information]{.alert} do files help organize?
  - Ownership and permissions
  - Access time, modification time, type, etc.

## Abstraction tradeoffs - discussion

::: {.nonincremental}
- Identify undesirable properties hidden by, new capabilities added, and info organization provided with these abstractions:
  - Process / threads
  - Address space
:::

::: {.notes}
Processes/Threads

- Hiding undesirable properties:
  - Example: The process abstraction hides the complexity of CPU scheduling and context switching. Applications don't need to manage the low-level details of how the CPU switches between different tasks. Similarly, the thread abstraction hides the intricacies of managing multiple execution paths within a single process, allowing developers to focus on the logic of concurrent tasks.
- Adding new capabilities:
  - Example: Processes provide isolation between different applications, ensuring that one misbehaving application doesn't affect others. Threads within a process allow for parallel execution of tasks, improving performance and responsiveness. Additionally, operating systems often provide inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, enabling processes to coordinate and share data.
- Organizing information:
  - Example: The process abstraction organizes the execution environment by encapsulating the code, data, and resources needed for a program to run. Threads further organize execution by dividing tasks within a process into smaller, manageable units. This organization helps in structuring complex applications and improving their maintainability.

Memory Address Space

- Hiding undesirable properties:
  - Example: The memory address space abstraction hides the physical memory layout from applications. Programs use virtual addresses, which the operating system maps to physical memory locations. This abstraction also hides the details of memory fragmentation and allocation, simplifying memory management for developers.
- Adding new capabilities:
  - Example: Virtual memory allows applications to use more memory than physically available by swapping data to and from disk. This capability enables larger and more complex applications to run on systems with limited physical memory. Additionally, memory protection mechanisms prevent one process from accessing the memory of another, enhancing system stability and security.
- Organizing information:
  - Example: The memory address space abstraction organizes memory into segments such as code, data, heap, and stack. This organization helps in managing different types of data efficiently and ensures that memory is used in a structured manner. For instance, the stack is used for function calls and local variables, while the heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.

## Abstraction pros / cons

- [Advantages]{.alert} of OS providing abstractions?
  - Allow applications to reuse common facilities
  - Make different devices look the same
  - Provide higher-level or more useful functionality
- [Challenges]{.alert}?
  - What are the correct abstractions?
  - How much should be exposed?

## OS design requirements - what do we need?

- [Convenience]{.alert}, abstraction of hardware resources for user programs
- [Efficiency]{.alert} of usage of CPU, memory, etc.
- [Isolation]{.alert} between multiple processes
- [Reliability]{.alert}, the OS must not fail
- Other:
  - Security
  - Mobility
