## What is an operating system?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

- Operating System:
  - A [computer program]{.alert} that
  - [multiplexes]{.alert} hardware resources and
  - implements useful [abstractions]{.alert}.
- The OS is just another computer program. Has the highest privilege. The core of the OS consists of the [kernel]{.alert}
- [Multiplexing]{.alert} allows multiple people or programs to use the same set of hardware resources - processors, memory, disks, network connection - safely and efficiently.
- [Abstractions]{.alert} simplify the usage of hardware resources by organizing information or implementing new capabilities.

# OS abstractions {background-color="#40666e"}

## Abstractions

- Abstractions _simplify application design_ by:
  - hiding undesirable properties,
  - adding new capabilities, and
  - organizing information
- Abstractions provide an [interface]{.alert} to application programmers that separates [policy]{.alert}—what the interface commits to accomplishing—from [mechanism]{.alert}—how the interface is implemented.

## What are the abstractions?

- CPUs
  - Processes, threads
- Memory
  - Address space
- Disk
  - Files

## Example OS abstraction: file systems

- What [undesirable properties]{.alert} do file systems hide?
  - Disks are slow!
  - Chunks of storage are actually distributed all over the disk
  - Disk storage may fail!
- What [new capabilities]{.alert} do files add?
  - Growth and shrinking
  - Organization into directories, searchability
- What [information]{.alert} do files help organize?
  - Ownership and permissions
  - Access time, modification time, type, etc.

## Abstraction tradeoffs - discussion

::: {.nonincremental}
- Identify undesirable properties hidden by, new capabilities added, and info organization provided with these abstractions:
  - Process / threads
  - Address space
:::

::: {.notes}
Processes/Threads

- Hiding undesirable properties:
  - Example: The process abstraction hides the complexity of CPU scheduling and context switching. Applications don't need to manage the low-level details of how the CPU switches between different tasks. Similarly, the thread abstraction hides the intricacies of managing multiple execution paths within a single process, allowing developers to focus on the logic of concurrent tasks.
- Adding new capabilities:
  - Example: Processes provide isolation between different applications, ensuring that one misbehaving application doesn't affect others. Threads within a process allow for parallel execution of tasks, improving performance and responsiveness. Additionally, operating systems often provide inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, enabling processes to coordinate and share data.
- Organizing information:
  - Example: The process abstraction organizes the execution environment by encapsulating the code, data, and resources needed for a program to run. Threads further organize execution by dividing tasks within a process into smaller, manageable units. This organization helps in structuring complex applications and improving their maintainability.

Memory Address Space

- Hiding undesirable properties:
  - Example: The memory address space abstraction hides the physical memory layout from applications. Programs use virtual addresses, which the operating system maps to physical memory locations. This abstraction also hides the details of memory fragmentation and allocation, simplifying memory management for developers.
- Adding new capabilities:
  - Example: Virtual memory allows applications to use more memory than physically available by swapping data to and from disk. This capability enables larger and more complex applications to run on systems with limited physical memory. Additionally, memory protection mechanisms prevent one process from accessing the memory of another, enhancing system stability and security.
- Organizing information:
  - Example: The memory address space abstraction organizes memory into segments such as code, data, heap, and stack. This organization helps in managing different types of data efficiently and ensures that memory is used in a structured manner. For instance, the stack is used for function calls and local variables, while the heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.

# Resource management {background-color="#40666e"}

## OS as a resource manager 


- Another view: [resource manager]{.alert} - shares resources "well"
- [Advantages]{.alert} of the OS managing resources?
  - Protect applications from one another
  - Provide efficient access to resources (cost, time, energy)
  - Provide fair access to resources
- [Challenges]{.alert}?
  - What are the correct mechanisms?
  - What are the correct policies?

## Resources are managed via [services]{.alert}

- Program Execution (loading, running, monitoring, terminating)
- Performance (optimizing resources under constraints)
- Correctness (overseeing critical operations, preventing interference)
- Fairness (access to and allocation of resources)
- Error detection & recovery (network partition & media failure)

## Services (cont'd)

- Communication (inter-process, software-to-hardware, hardware-to-hardware, system-to-system, wide-area)
- I/O: reading & writing, support for various mediums, devices, performance, and protections
- Data Organization (naming), Services (search) & Protection (access control)
- Security (isolation, enforcement, services, authentication, accounting and logging, trust)
- User interfaces (command-line, GUIs, multiple users)

## Each service has [challenges]{.alert} and [tensions]{.alert}

Example 1: We have limited RAM, and we want to run more programs that can be stored. 
  
- How do we allocate space?
- Who stays?
- Who goes? 
- What if we're wrong? 
- What if the system is under extremely heavy load?
- Is there a way to predict the future?

## Each service has [challenges]{.alert} and [tensions]{.alert}

Example 2: We have two process (producer / consumer); how do they communicate? 

- Message passing? Shared memory? 
- How do they synchronize? 
  - How to we prevent over-production? Over-consumption?
  - Context-switching?

# Kernel basics {background-color="#40666e"}

## Briefly: what happens at boot?

- [BIOS / UEFI]{.alert} initializes devices and finds the next program to run
- [Bootloader]{.alert}: simple code to initialize the system, load the kernel
  - Why do we need a bootloader?
    - Safe mode
- Kernel loads
  - First process: init (example: systemd), pid == 1
    - Parent of all processes
    - Init starts [system daemons]{.alert} (services provided outside of the kernel)

## Paradigms

- The OS offers a number of services. What should go in the kernel?
  - IPC
  - VFS
  - File system
  - Scheduler
  - Virtual Memory
  - Device drivers

## Monolithic kernels

- Oldest, very common design (Linux, Windows 9x, BSDs)
- Single piece of code in memory
- Limited [information hiding]{.alert}
  - One part of the kernel can directly access data and functions of other parts

## Monolithic kernels (cont'd)

Q: What happens when you need something new supported (new hardware device, new system call, new filesystem)? 

- [Modules]{.alert} (loadable kernel modules - LKMs) allow for flexibility, customization, support 
  - Pros?
    - Memory savings
    - Flexibility
    - Minimal downtime
  - Cons? 
    - (minor) fragmentation: the base kernel can be loaded contiguously in memory
    - Security ([https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine) **DO NOT USE THIS, IT'S SIMPLY TO SHOW YOU**)

## Layered kernels

- Dijkstra created the THE OS in the 60s, introducing the concept
Each inner layer is more privileged; required a trap to move down layers
- Hardware-enforcement possible
- Intel [announced](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/envisioning-future-simplified-architecture.html) in May 2024 that the new architectures will only have rings 0 and 3

## Microkernels

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

- Popular research area long ago, didn't win (although people remain interested in the principles)
- All non-essential components removed from the kernel, for modularization, extensibility, isolation, security, and ease of management
- A collection of OS services running in user space
- Downsides? 
  - Heavy communication costs through message passing (marshaled through the kernel)

# Process basics {background-color="#40666e"}

## Process isolation

Q: How can we ensure that a user process doesn't harm others?

## Dual-mode operation

- Dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itself and components
  - [User mode]{.alert} and [kernel]{.alert} mode 
- Mode bit provided by hardware 
  - Provides ability to distinguish when system is running user code or kernel code.
  - When a user is running → mode bit is "user"
  - When kernel code is executing → mode bit is "kernel"
- [System call]{.alert} changes mode to kernel, return from call resets it to user
- Some instructions are only executable in kernel mode

## System calls

- The OS offers a number of services. How do we (applications) interface with them?
  - We don't want to deal with the details, just the abstraction
  - The OS has ultimate control over these operations
- System calls are the "language" of communication with the OS
- Standards
  - Win32 (MS)
  - POSIX (nearly all Unix-based systems)
  - Java API for the JVM

## System calls (cont'd)

- Like a function call, we push arguments onto the stack, then we call into the library that provides the system call
- Each system call has a special number, placed into a register
- Executes a TRAP instruction (switch to kernel mode)
- A logical separation of memory space
- Kernel's system call handler is invoked, once done (but may block) may be returned to the process

## System calls (cont'd)

- Table defined in the kernel: [https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl)
- You can run using the table values themselves using the `syscall()` wrapper
  - Q: why does `syscall()` exist?
  - If you're interested… There are debates [https://lwn.net/Articles/771441/](https://lwn.net/Articles/771441/)

# Assignment 1: SLOsh {background-color="#40666e"}

## SLOsh

- This assignment should be a refresher of 357 topics
- Your shell will support: 
  - basic command execution
  - built-in commands
  - signal handling
  - I/O redirection
  - piping

## Requirements

::: {.nonincremental}
- C99 POSIX
- Must compile / run on the unix* servers
- You must create a functional Makefile
- Submit a tar (.tgz) file in Canvas
:::

## Command execution

- Execute external commands 
  - Use `fork()`, `exec()`, and `waitpid()` to manage process execution
- Support command-line arguments
- Handle both relative and absolute paths to executables
- Report command execution errors appropriately

## Redirection / piping

- Use `open()`, `dup2()`, and `close()` for file redirection
- Use `pipe()` for creating pipes between processes

## Signal handling

- Signals are async. They can happen at any time
- Certain functions are async-safe, others are not
  - `printf()` contains internal buffers and state; an interruption can lead to corrupted buffers 

## Handling SIGINT

- `write()` a newline or whatever to signify the signal was caught.
- If there is not a child running, `write()` a new prompt
- Why not just use `display_prompt()`?
  - If it's using `write()` it could be fine. If it's using `printf()` it isn't

## Parent vs child

- The child should immediately reset signal handling to the default
- Look up `signal()`'s man
  ```{.bash code-line-numbers=false}
  man 2 signal
  ``` 

## Sigaction

- `sigaction()` is newer than `signal()`
- Offers more control and is more consistent across systems
- Allows specifying flags
  - SA_RESTART (`man 7 signal`)
    - Without it, syscalls return with EINTR error if they are interrupted by a signal
    - With it, most syscalls automatically restart
- Is the POSIX-compliant approach
- EINTR can still happen, it's wise to check for it and handle it
  - When reading input from user
