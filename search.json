    "text": "Abstraction tradeoffs - discussion\n\nIdentify undesirable properties hidden by, new capabilities added, and info organization provided with these abstractions:\n\nProcess / threads\nAddress space\n\n\n\nProcesses/Threads\n\nHiding undesirable properties:\n\nExample: The process abstraction hides the complexity of CPU scheduling and context switching. Applications don’t need to manage the low-level details of how the CPU switches between different tasks. Similarly, the thread abstraction hides the intricacies of managing multiple execution paths within a single process, allowing developers to focus on the logic of concurrent tasks.\n\nAdding new capabilities:\n\nExample: Processes provide isolation between different applications, ensuring that one misbehaving application doesn’t affect others. Threads within a process allow for parallel execution of tasks, improving performance and responsiveness. Additionally, operating systems often provide inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, enabling processes to coordinate and share data.\n\nOrganizing information:\n\nExample: The process abstraction organizes the execution environment by encapsulating the code, data, and resources needed for a program to run. Threads further organize execution by dividing tasks within a process into smaller, manageable units. This organization helps in structuring complex applications and improving their maintainability.\n\n\nMemory Address Space\n\nHiding undesirable properties:\n\nExample: The memory address space abstraction hides the physical memory layout from applications. Programs use virtual addresses, which the operating system maps to physical memory locations. This abstraction also hides the details of memory fragmentation and allocation, simplifying memory management for developers.\n\nAdding new capabilities:\n\nExample: Virtual memory allows applications to use more memory than physically available by swapping data to and from disk. This capability enables larger and more complex applications to run on systems with limited physical memory. Additionally, memory protection mechanisms prevent one process from accessing the memory of another, enhancing system stability and security.\n\nOrganizing information:\n\nExample: The memory address space abstraction organizes memory into segments such as code, data, heap, and stack. This organization helps in managing different types of data efficiently and ensures that memory is used in a structured manner. For instance, the stack is used for function calls and local variables, while the heap is used for dynamic memory allocation."
